/**
 * The function that will be executed by the runner.
 *
 * You can change the names of the function or its parameters, but keep the "export default" since that's what the runner looks for.
 * You can add more code outside of this function if you want, but only this function with "export default" will be called directly.
 *
 * @param {string} input - The full text of the file as one long string.
 * @param {string[]} lines - An array of strings representing each line of the file.
 * @param {...string} [args] - An array of additional parameters passed when running `npm start <puzzle> [arg0] [arg1...]`.
 *        Not necessary for the runner to function and can be safely ignored, but may be useful later for quick testing.
 * @return {*} - The solution to the puzzle, which the runner will print to the console. Can be any type of value.
